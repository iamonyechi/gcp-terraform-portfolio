🚀 Beginner Cloud Portfolio: Upgrading to CI/CD with Terraform + Google Cloud + GitHub Actions

📘 Project Overview (Updated for CI/CD)
This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website via Google Cloud Storage using the IaC tool Terraform, fully automated and managed as code through a GitHub-based CI/CD pipeline.
The inspiration for this project comes from the challenge of getting started in the cloud. When I began my journey, I didn’t know where to start. This project is part of a beginner-friendly Cloud Project Playbook — something I wish I had. It walks you through cloud fundamentals while showcasing professionalism, structure, and clarity.
