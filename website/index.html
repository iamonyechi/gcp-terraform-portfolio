    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website via Google Cloud Storage using the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool Terraform, fully automated and managed as code. The inspiration behind this project is to provide a beginner-friendly example for those new to cloud computing and Terraform—a practical, approachable starting point to build confidence and skills.

    <h2>Why This Project?</h2>
    <p>
      When I started my cloud journey, I didnt know where to begin. This project serves as the foundation for a cloud project playbook aimed at beginners—a resource I wish I had when starting out. It guides aspiring professionals through fundamental cloud concepts and Terraform practices, helping them build a real, deployable project from scratch.
